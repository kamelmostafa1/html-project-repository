<h1>Applications of artificial intelligence</h1>
<p>With the current popularization of the Internet, the universal existence of sensors, the emergence of big data, development of e-commerce, rise of the information community, and the interconnection and fusion of data and knowledge with society, physical space, and cyberspace, the information environment for AI development has been changed profoundly, leading to a new evolutionary phase: AI 2.0 (Pan, 2016). The emergence of new technologies also enables a new phase of AI. The main features of AI 2.0 include the emergence of data-driven intuitive perception ability for intensive deep learning, Internet-based swarm intelligence, technology-oriented human-machine hybrid augmented intelligence, as well as the rise of cross-media reasoning (Pan, 2016).

The continuous evolution of smart cities, intelligent medical care, intelligent transportation, intelligent logistics, intelligent robots, self-driving vehicles, smart-phones, intelligent toys, smart communities, and smart economies, to name but a few, provides a broad market demand and driving force in terms of new development of both AI technologies and applications.</p>

<h1>Artificial intelligence facilitates the development of intelligent manufacturing</h1>
<p>We believe that intelligent manufacturing is a new manufacturing model and the technical means by which new information and communication technology, intelligent science and technology, large manufacturing technology (including design, production, management, testing, and integration), system engineering technology, and related product technology are integrated with the whole system and lifecycle of product development. The life cycle of manufacturing thus uses autonomous sensing, interconnection, collaboration, learning, analysis, cognition, decision-making, control, and the execution of human, machine, material, and environmental information to enable the integration and optimization of various aspects of a manufacturing enterprise or group, including three elements (people/organizations, operational management, and equipment and technology) and five flows (information flow, logistics flow, capital flow, knowledge flow, and service flow). This facilitates production and provides a high efficiency, high quality, cost-effective, and environment-friendly service for users, and therefore improves the market competitiveness of the manufacturing enterprise or group.

AI technology facilitates the development of new models, means, and forms, system architecture, and technology systems in the domain of intelligent manufacturing (Li et al., 2014; NMSAC and SAC-CAE, 2016).</p>
