<h1>Future of artificial intelligence</h1>
<p>EVOLUTION FROM WEAK AI TO STRONG AI
Weak AI systems and solutions are characterized as those that are narrowly focused on typically one area. The aforementioned VPA technology is a good example. In contrast, Strong AI is getting much closer to sentient beings such as humans, and have traits of self-awareness. In other words, Strong AI is more like human-level intelligence.

AI systems will evolve from monolithic, single-purpose systems to more integrated AI systems that singularly, or in the case of multiple connected systems, collectively represent Strong AI. The use of Strong AI systems to provide orchestration and overall governance of lesser AI modules will enable intelligence that has broader contextual decision making capabilities.

ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
While many forms of AI today are oriented towards one type of information or means of gathering and interpreting data, General AI pertains to those systems that have the ability to learn from many different environments. In other words, Artificial General Intelligence performs more like a human being in terms of ability to make use of inputs and data which normal AI would ignore as disparate and seemingly insignificant.

One of the challenges of creating AI which can think like a human is that machines do not behave in the same ways or share the same sense of values. These traits are part of the human condition that has bearing on the decision process. Another challenge is creating machines that have the human ability to make inferences and judgements based on limited information and nuance.

For example, humans can apply experiential learning in ways that computers currently cannot. In addition, machines find certain tasks very difficult that are remarkably easy for humans, such as identifying the face of an old friend that has not been seen for years.

SUPERINTELLIGENCE
One of the potential precursors to human evolution is the supplementation of biological matter with silicon. Stated differently, humans may be augmented with computing and artificial intelligence allowing for the best of both worlds in a sense â€“ fast processing power with human cognition including unique human traits such as intuition.

Superintelligence is not guaranteed or preordained based on current advancements of AI. However, many leading experts believe it is certainly possible, and may take various shapes and forms such as computer-brain integration. Those that profess the advantages of such integration suggest that there will be cognitive enhancement for both human and machine, leading to amplification of decision making for both organic and silicon systems.</p>
