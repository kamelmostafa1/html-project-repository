<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<p>The AI segment is currently very fragmented, characterized with most companies focusing on silo approaches to solutions. Longer term, Mind Commerce sees many solutions involving multiple AI types as well as integration across other key areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics.

    Mind Commerce AI reports focus on solutions to specific problems, AI support of various apps and services, as well as AI integration with other technologies such as Big Data, IoT, and Blockchain. A sampling of Mind Commerce AI reports includes:

<p>There are many potential use cases for AI within the cybersecurity domain. For example, AI may be used in IoT to bolster security, safeguard assets, and reduce fraud.

    There are varying opinions about security in IoT. For example, some companies favor a distributed (decentralized) approach whereas other companies believe a more centralized approach leveraging strictly centralized cloud architecture makes more sense.
    
    Mind Commerce sees no way in which signature based security solutions will work with IoT in an edge computing environment for a variety of reasons including the limitation on throughput of communications between distributed end-points and centralized cloud.</p>
